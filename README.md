# Linear-Regression


Purpose:
In this assignment, you have to perform the required basic exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, 
and then implement and perform various types of regression algorithms we have learned so far. For each section, 
you must have to put the question and an appropriate header text as a text cell. And after the header, you 
can use multiple cells for coding and explaining, and plotting.



Data Context:
An e-commerce company based in Florida sells clothing Online. However, they also have style sessions and 
clothing advice sessions at their on-site locations. In an in-store session, customers come into the store, have 
sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website 
for the clothes they want. 

The company is trying to decide whether to focus its efforts on its mobile app experience or its website. Also, 
they would like to build a predictive model to get an idea of the yearly amount spent by a customer based on their 
data. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! 

Additionally, your task is not only to solve the problem but also to show that you can apply and understand 
various types of regression techniques we have learned in the class
